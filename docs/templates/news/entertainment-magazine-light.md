# news/entertainment-magazine-light

Fixed light-tone template for Vietnamese entertainment news generated from a
public article URL or source-backed text. It is designed for music, film,
television, celebrities, books, fashion, red carpet, awards, streaming, and
pop-culture releases.

## Input Contract

Use only facts, images, videos, dates, credits, names, quotes, release details,
rankings, box-office figures, ratings, awards, fashion brands, publishers, and
attribution available from the supplied article or public source media. Do not
fabricate source media, statements, personal relationships, accusations,
sales numbers, chart positions, reviews, awards, or private-life details.

Prefer this template when the article is about:

- film, music, television, streaming, books, fashion, celebrity profiles, or
  cultural events;
- release announcements, premieres, concerts, book launches, runway stories,
  red-carpet appearances, rankings, reviews, or awards;
- visual entertainment stories where posters, portraits, stills, cover art,
  runway images, or event photos are part of the evidence.

Use a civic, health, real-estate, or tech template instead when the story is
mainly policy, public safety, business infrastructure, medicine, or technology.

## Visual System

- 9:16 composition, 1080x1920, 30fps.
- Light entertainment magazine look: ivory paper, blush editorial washes,
  plum body text, coral accent, citron ticket details, and source media frames.
- Typography uses `Newsreader` for expressive headlines and `Inter` for
  labels, body, facts, quotes, captions, and subtitles.
- The visual language should feel like a culture magazine page, not a civic
  dossier, medical bulletin, real-estate grid, or tech dashboard.
- Source images and videos are rendered as poster/photo frames with visible
  attribution: `Nguồn: <credit>`.
- Source video is muted and looped.
- Voice subtitles sit near the bottom, with the active spoken word in coral.

## Editorial Safety Rules

- Keep a lively but factual Vietnamese journalistic tone.
- Do not use insulting, invasive, or certainty-heavy language about private
  life, relationships, accusations, illness, or legal matters.
- If the source frames something as rumor, speculation, fan reaction, or social
  media discussion, preserve that uncertainty.
- Attribute quotes and reviews to the source, outlet, critic, publisher,
  artist, studio, organizer, or named person.
- Distinguish between official announcement, reported claim, review opinion,
  chart/ranking, fan reaction, and unverified social-media discussion.
- Do not invent review scores, box-office data, streaming ranks, awards, or
  publication dates.

## Spec Schema

Write `videos/<slug>/spec.json` as:

```ts
interface EntertainmentMagazineLightSpec {
  templateId: "news/entertainment-magazine-light";
  slug: string;
  totalFrames: number;
  video: {
    title: string;
    date: string;
    articleUrl?: string;
    publisher?: string;
    bgMusic?: string | null;
  };
  scenes: Array<{
    type: "entertainmentMagazineLight";
    startFrame: number;
    durationFrames: number;
    audioSegment: { start: number; end: number; text: string };
    entertainment: {
      variant:
        | "opening"
        | "profile"
        | "release"
        | "media"
        | "quote"
        | "timeline"
        | "rank"
        | "review"
        | "gallery"
        | "closing";
      section: string;
      headline: string;
      accentWords?: string[];
      kicker?: string;
      body?: string;
      body2?: string;
      media?: {
        src: string;
        storage?: "local" | "remote";
        credit: string;
        alt?: string;
        fit?: "cover" | "contain";
        position?: string;
        mediaType?: "ẢNH" | "VIDEO" | "POSTER" | "BÌA SÁCH" | "LOOKBOOK";
      };
      mediaHeight?: number;
      facts?: Array<{ label: string; value: string; note?: string }>;
      timeline?: Array<{ time: string; label: string; detail?: string }>;
      quote?: { text: string; source: string; context?: string };
      rating?: { label: string; value: string; note?: string };
      tags?: string[];
      cta?: string;
      hashtags?: string;
    };
  }>;
}
```

## Step 6 Output

Create:

```json
{
  "templateId": "news/entertainment-magazine-light",
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "totalFrames": 1200,
  "video": {
    "title": "<Vietnamese title - max 8 words>",
    "date": "<DD/MM/YYYY>",
    "bgMusic": "assets/news/music/nastelbom-soft-music.mp3"
  },
  "scenes": []
}
```

`bgMusic` should usually be `"assets/news/music/nastelbom-soft-music.mp3"`.
For urgent entertainment controversies, use `"assets/news/music/news-ambient-01.mp3"`
instead of dramatic breaking-news music unless the source is truly urgent.

Use `docs/gen-video/common-pipeline.md` Shared Timing Contract.

## Scene Guidance

Use 6-8 scenes for a typical 45-70 second video.

- `opening`: main hook with strongest image/poster/portrait and article angle.
- `profile`: artist, actor, author, designer, director, or public figure context.
- `release`: album, film, series, book, collection, concert, show, or campaign
  detail. Use `facts` for date, platform, venue, publisher, studio, or format.
- `media`: source poster, still, cover art, runway or event image with factual
  body copy.
- `quote`: attributed quote, review excerpt, official statement, or article
  quote. Do not invent quotes.
- `timeline`: release timeline, controversy sequence, award path, tour schedule,
  or public-reaction sequence. Keep it source-backed.
- `rank`: chart position, box-office figure, streaming rank, bestseller list,
  award count, or social metric from the source.
- `review`: critical reception or comparison. Use `rating` only when the source
  provides a score, label, or clear ranking.
- `gallery`: second/third source visual such as red carpet, lookbook, book cover,
  still image, stage image, or poster detail.
- `closing`: what happens next, next release date, award night, official response,
  or source-led takeaway.

Headline rules:

- Use manual line breaks in `headline` with `\n`.
- Keep opening headlines to 3-5 short lines.
- Keep other headlines to 2-4 lines.
- Put exact phrases to become coral italic in `accentWords`.
- Avoid tabloid phrasing, insults, and invasive private-life framing.

Copy rules:

- `section` is a short uppercase ticket label such as `MUSIC`, `FILM`, `BOOKS`,
  `FASHION`, `PROFILE`, `REVIEW`, `AWARDS`, `POP CULTURE`.
- `kicker` is optional and should be short, not a second headline.
- Keep each body field under about 135 Vietnamese characters.
- Use `tags` for short culture categories such as `Album`, `Premiere`, `Runway`,
  `Bestseller`, `Streaming`, `Oscar`, `Phỏng vấn`.
- Do not duplicate subtitles in scene text.

Media rules:

- Accept still media: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`.
- Accept source video: `.mp4`, `.mov`; render muted and looped.
- Reject `.gif`, `.svg`, `.avif`, `.bmp`, tracking pixels, logos, avatar
  thumbnails, and unrelated decorative icons.
- Remote media must be public and CORS-renderable.
- Every media item must include `credit`.
- Use `mediaType: "POSTER"` for film/music posters, `"BÌA SÁCH"` for book
  covers, and `"LOOKBOOK"` for fashion/editorial images when appropriate.
- If no reliable source media exists, prefer `quote`, `timeline`, `rank`,
  `review`, or text-led `release` scenes.

## Step 7 Coder

Use the fixed components:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AbsoluteFill, Audio, Series, staticFile } from 'remotion';
import { EntertainmentScene, Layout } from '../templates/news/entertainment-magazine-light';
import type { EntertainmentMagazineLightSpec } from '../templates/news/entertainment-magazine-light';
import specData from '../../videos/<slug>/spec.json';

const spec = specData as EntertainmentMagazineLightSpec;

export const VideoContent: React.FC<{ slug: string }> = ({ slug }) => (
  <Layout slug={slug} bgMusic={spec.video.bgMusic ?? null}>
    <Audio src={staticFile(`${slug}/voice.mp3`)} />
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <Series>
        {spec.scenes.map((scene, i) => (
          <Series.Sequence key={i} durationInFrames={scene.durationFrames} premountFor={30}>
            <EntertainmentScene
              {...scene.entertainment}
              durationFrames={scene.durationFrames}
            />
          </Series.Sequence>
        ))}
      </Series>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  </Layout>
);
```
